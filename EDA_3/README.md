# EDA and Machine Learning on Diamonds Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning on a diamonds dataset. The aim is to explore the data, understand the relationships between various features, and build a predictive model for diamond prices.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following sections:
- **Dataset Acquisition:** Downloading the diamonds dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, handling duplicates, and converting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, identifying outliers, and examining correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Refining the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns and creating new features.
- **Modeling (if applicable):** Building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict diamond prices.

## Dataset

The diamonds dataset contains the prices and attributes of approximately 54,000 diamonds. The key attributes include:

- `carat`: Weight of the diamond.
- `cut`: Quality of the diamond cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- `color`: Diamond color, with a scale from D (best) to J (worst).
- `clarity`: Diamond clarity, with a scale from IF (best) to I1 (worst).
- `depth`: Total depth percentage (z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y)).
- `table`: Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
- `price`: Price of the diamond.
- `x`: Length in mm.
- `y`: Width in mm.
- `z`: Depth in mm.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicates were dropped to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Categorical features such as `cut`, `color`, and `clarity` were converted to appropriate categories.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Inspection:** Basic inspection of the data structure, including the shape, data types, and summary statistics.
- **Box Plots:** Visualized the distributions of numerical features to identify outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between numerical features using heatmaps.

### Feature Engineering

- **Column Dropping:** Irrelevant columns like `Unnamed: 0`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were dropped as they were not useful for the analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Focused on the most relevant features for modeling.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the notebook:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (if deep learning models are included)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diamonds-eda-ml.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd diamonds-eda-ml
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook EDA_EDA_and_ML_for_diamonds_dataset_ipynb.ipynb
```

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially. The notebook is designed to be run in order, with each cell building upon the previous ones.

### Key Sections:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Helps you understand the data through visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepares the data for modeling by handling duplicates and converting data types.
- **Feature Engineering:** Refines the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and analyzing correlations.
- **Modeling (if applicable):** Builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict diamond prices.
